/**
 * Moves focus into a dialog when it opens, keeps Tab inside it while open, and
 * returns focus to the trigger on close, per the WAI-ARIA dialog pattern.
 *
 * Without this, opening a dialog leaves focus on the button behind it: Tab walks
 * the background page instead of the dialog, and screen readers are never taken
 * to the dialog's contents. Attach the returned ref to the element carrying
 * role="dialog" and give that element tabIndex={-1} so it can receive focus.
 *
 * aria-modal="true" only tells assistive tech that the rest of the page is inert
 * — it does not stop Tab from reaching background controls — so the wrap is
 * enforced here in a keydown handler rather than left to the browser.
 *
 * Only depends on `active`, so it runs on the open/close transition rather than on
 * every render — re-running it on each render would yank focus back out of the
 * dialog.
 *
 * Pass `focusContainer: false` for dialogs that already put focus on a specific
 * control of their own (a search field, a roving tablist). They still get the Tab
 * wrap and the focus restore; only the initial container focus is skipped, so the
 * hook does not fight the more specific placement.
